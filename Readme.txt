Project Description:
This project is based Fashion Search AI engine that utilizes the Myntra dataset obtained from Kaggle, which was modified for the project. For more detailed information, refer to the Project Report: "Fashion Search AI."

Objectives:
The main objective of this project is to develop a fashion query response system that utilizes AI models to provide detailed and user-friendly responses to fashion-related queries. The system aims to enhance user experience by generating informative and contextually relevant answers, thereby assisting users in finding fashion items based on their preferences.

Design:
The solution POC includes 3 stages comprising:
1. Intent Clarity & confirmation layer
2. Product mapping & information extraction layer
3. Product recommendation laey
4. Dialogue management system

Implementation:
The implementation involved several steps, including data preprocessing, model integration, and query response generation.

Requirements to run the code:
API key:  OpenAI_API_key.txt in location '/content/drive/MyDrive/FashionSearchAI'
Dataset:  FashionDataset.csv in '/content/drive/MyDrive/FashionSearchAI'

Sample Input to dialogue management system:
1. Looking for women wear in white colour price 1000 INR and rating 1
2. yellow dress in price 10000 and rating 1
3. Red colour dress at price 600INR and rating 2
